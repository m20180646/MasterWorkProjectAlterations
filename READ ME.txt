READ ME:

To fully run the shiny application, the user has to download and extract the data zip and the web zip. There is also a video in the application, and since the file is to big to be uploaded in github please download the video using this link: https://1drv.ms/v/s!Aing147KxUoBiAzkbqgpSFEGP_VF?e=ds4Vqi

After downloading the video please put it inside the www (unzipped) folder.

Then the user needs to open all the files (app.R, preprocess.R and the data and www folders) in RStudio, run the preprocess.R Rscript and the app.R scrip after.
